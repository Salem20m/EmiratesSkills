**MENU**

Enjoy our dishes with top quality ingredients.


Fiambre
A mixture of cold cuts and vegetables, chicken broth, cheeses and more that requires weeks of preparation and a lot of work. Still, it is a traditional dish of the celebration on All Saints' Day, an exceptional mix of flavors.
Q40


Kak Ik
A dish typical of the Q'eqchi 'region, this broth is one of the favorites for its “chunto” (turkey) meat, different vegetables, spices and chili, a lot of chili. Rice to accompany, "pochitos" (butter tamales) and cocoa or pinol to drink. A delight.
Q30


Paches
Made with potatoes and a message with enough tomato to give that red color -and great flavor- to one of the classic dishes on Thursdays. It tastes better if it brings chili and chicken.
Q35


Pepián
Some of the ingredients of this Guatemalan delicacy are guaque chili, raisin, pepitoria, cinnamon, tomato, banana peel, tomato, cinnamon and much more. This dish is very special since it is prepared with 100% Guatemalan ingredients with an artisanal elaboration.
Q25

Enchiladas
Toast with minced meat, cheese, a touch of egg, sauce, cheese, and beets for that signature color. A challenge to eat it without breaking the toast, but with a wonderful flavor to try.
Q28

Tamal
With corn dough and an errand along with chicken or pork, tamales are a favorite meal on Saturdays, or at New Year's Eve parties. Along with a French bread and coffee, great.
